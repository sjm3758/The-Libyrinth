# The-Libyrinth
A first-person stealth game developed as a team class project.

Navigate the eerie halls of a forgotten library as seemingly endless corridors surround you. Reach the exits and progress through increasingly complex levels with your trusty flashlight. Beware of the ghosts of past librarians who stalk the halls in search of their next victim... YOU!

Download and extract the zip folder and run the executable within to begin playing. Developed in Unity for PC. Compatible with Mouse/Keyboard and Controllers.

My primary role was Audio Engineer where I coded a singleton system in C# to manage audio files and control music playback depending on player interactions with the world. I also designed and prototyped various gameplay features and tested assets and lighting in debug environments. Additional Credits to Seth Leyens, Alexia Bernardo, Mike SanGiovanni, and Nicholas Cato on development team.
